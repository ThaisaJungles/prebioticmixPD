Qiime2 script of 16S rRNA data analysis from in vitro fecal fermentation studies conducted for the project entitled: "Used as part of the "Multi-Targeted Prebiotics Modulate Gut Microbiome and Improve Intestinal Barrier Function in Parkinson's Disease: Proof-of-Concept Study".

16S rRNA sequencing data and metadata can be accessed on NCBI SRA PRJNA852512.   

Qiime outputs (ASV table, and taxonomy table) and metadata were uploaded to MicrobiomeAnalyst (https://microbiomeanalyst.ca/) for clustered heatmap processing and vizualization.
