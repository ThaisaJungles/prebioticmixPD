Qiime2 script of 16S rRNA data analysis from in vitro fecal fermentation studies that are part of the project entitled: "Used as part of the "Multi-Targeted Prebiotics Modulate Gut Microbiome and Improve Intestinal Barrier Function in Parkinson's Disease: Proof-of-Concept Study"
16S rRNA sequencing data and metadata can be accessed on NCBI SRA PRJNA852512.   
Qiime outputs (metadata, ASV table, and taxonomy table) were uploaded to MicrobiomeAnalyst (https://microbiomeanalyst.ca/) for clustered heatmap processing and vizualization.
